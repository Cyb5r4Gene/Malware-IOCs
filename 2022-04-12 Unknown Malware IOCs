THREAT IDENTIFICATION:  UNKNOWN MALWARE

ANALYST NOTES
The emails are both "adult" themed and list a url to download a .zip file.
The .zip file contains a handful of suggestive photos and one .scr file.
After launching the .scr file, I saw a download of a file with a .jpg extension.
The downloaded file is not a .jpg - it's a reversed executable file.
The .scr file process was mostly sitting at ~50% of the CPU utilization.
After about 30 minutes, I saw calls made to a few Microsoft storage urls.
After that, a video was launched (it's a short .mp4 file with a related image and unintelligible audio).
Once the video finished playing, the .scr process exited.
Looking at the hard drive after this run, I saw an empty folder named \AppData\Local\Yandex\YaAddon.
Also, the video that was downloaded was saved to: AppData\Local\Temp.
