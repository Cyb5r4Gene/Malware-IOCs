Hi, I found your address on the website!
I'm not that far away from you and I think we could get to know each other!

I have nothing to hide, I'm just trying to enjoy life!

I think we could start by exchanging photos and videos and if everything suits us, then we could continue further!
I sent you a video and a photo in this link!
