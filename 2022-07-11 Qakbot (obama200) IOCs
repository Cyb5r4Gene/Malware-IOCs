THREAT IDENTIFICATION:  QAKBOT ("obama200")

NOTES:
As usual with Qakbot, the emails use previously stolen email threads.
The emails have a brief comment prepended to the stolen thread with a message to the recipient.
It's usually something like, "here is the document you requested" or a similar message.
While we saw some dramtic TTP changes today, things started as usual with an attached .html file.
The .html file opens in a browser and uses "HTML Smuggling" to drop an embedded .zip file to the hard drive.
The browser page displays something like: "Download Completed - The document was successfully downloaded".
At this point, the user has not been infected - there's just a malicious .zip file on the hard drive.
The dropped .zip file has the same name as the .html file (but with a .zip extension).
The .zip file is password protected and the password is "abc321".
The .zip file contains an .iso file this time - just an additional layer to bury the payload files.
Contained in the .iso file is an .lnk file, calc.exe and 2 .dll files - WindowsCodecs.dll and 102755.dll.
This is where things get interesting - I can't recall seeing this technique used before.
The .lnk file runs calc.exe - upon startup, calc.exe (by default) loads several dependencies.
One dependency is a file named WindowsCodecs.dll which should be familiar - it's one of the dropped files.
In this case, the version dropped by the threat actors is loaded instead of the legitimate Microsoft version.
This is because the threat actors' version is in the same folder as the dependent executable.
As a result, it finds and loads its version instead of the copy stored in the Windows system32 folder.
This technique is called "DLL Search Order Hijacking" (MITRE T1574).
The Qakbot version of the WindowsCodecs DLL has an export named DllEntryPoint which spawns a regsvr32 process.
This regsvr32 is used to launch the Qakbot payload .dll file (102755.dll).

SUBJECTS OBSERVED
All subjects were from previously stolen email threads.
