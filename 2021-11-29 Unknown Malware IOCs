THREAT ATTRIBUTION:  UNKNOWN MALWARE

ANALYST NOTES
This email seems to have been sent prematurely by the threat actor(s).
The theme is a "mandatory COVID-19 Test" and the email has an attached .docx file.
Recipients are told that they've been scheduled for a mandatory Covid test.
The last line reads: "If you think there was a mistake, please fill out the provided form".
The attached form is a .docx file which appears similar to other malicious Office files that we see.
However, upon opening the document, a number of problems arise - the first is a "Certificate error".
This error box also displays: "The application experienced an internal error loading the SSL libraries".
Despite the error, I see calls made to a Github repository - visiting the url manually returns a 404.
I visited the base repository and found a similarly named .docm file.
After downloading and launching that, I saw more errors: "Compile error: Can't find project or library".
I saw no additional network traffic from this point.
