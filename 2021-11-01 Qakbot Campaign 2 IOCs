THREAT IDENTIFICATION:  QAKBOT

ANALYST NOTES
I also found additional Qakbot emails from a separate campaign today.
These emails are also using stolen email threads.
A .zip file is attached to each email and each .zip file contains an .xls file.
The .xls file theme for this campaign is a white, black and blue Docusign theme.
The spreadsheet reads: "This document encrypted by DocuSign Protect Service".
In this case, the emails have a .zip file attachment which contains an .xls file.
When opened and macros enabled, the Excel file tries to download and launch an executable file from 3 locations.
The payload spawns an explorer.exe process which, after a while, communicates with multiple C2 servers.
Today, however, I was unable to get a payload.

SUBJECTS OBSERVED
All of the subjects were from stolen email threads.
