THREAT ATTRIBUTION:  BUMBLEBEE LOADER

THREAT IDENTIFICATION:  BUMBLEBEE LOADER

ANALYST NOTES
The new Bumblebee infection flow (typically) begins with an iniital contact request submitted via a web form.
After receiving a reply email (even just an out-of-office or other auto-reply), the threat actor follows up.
Brief back and forth email exchanges can occur now which is meant to gain the confidence of the recipient.
Soon, the threat actor will suggest that they set up a phone meeting (with likely no intention of attending).
Next, The threat actor suggests that the recipient might want to review details of the project prior to the phone call.
Shortly, after that, the recipient receives an email sent from one of several file sharing services.
The email has a link to download the "project details" - it's easy to guess the rest of the story from here.
However, there's yet another oddity - the file to be downloaded is named "<companyname>.vhd".
The .vhd file is typically a virtual hard disk file for (primarily) Windows Virtual PC.
It's basically just a compressed file and is used that way here.
Once the file is unzipped, it contains an .lnk file and a Powershell script (this should be familiar).
The .lnk file launches the Powershell script.
The PowerShell script is obfuscated and split into multiple big base64 blocks (the blocks also seem to be compressed).
I'm assuming that the Powershell script uses this to dump and launch the payload since I saw no network traffic.
I was unable to get beyond this point - likely due to the heavy anti-VM tactics Bumblebee uses.
